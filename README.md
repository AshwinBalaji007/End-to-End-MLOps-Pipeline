This project demonstrates a complete, production-grade MLOps pipeline built and deployed entirely on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. The use case is a real-time wine quality prediction service, but the core of the project is the robust, automated, and scalable cloud engineering framework.
The entire CI/CD workflow is automated: a `git push` to the main branch triggers a pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the new version of the application with zero downtime.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains a complete, production-grade MLOps pipeline built on **AWS**, demonstrating the full lifecycle of a machine learning model. The use case is a real-time wine quality prediction service, but the core of the project is the robust, automated, and scalable cloud engineering framework.

The entire workflow is automated using **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**: a `git push` to the main branch automatically builds a new Docker image, pushes it to a container registry, and deploys it to a production environment running on an EC2 instance.

This project also integrates **MLflow** for robust experiment tracking, model logging, and ensuring reproducibility.

## ‚ú® About MLflow

**MLflow** is a production-grade, open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. In this project, it is used for:

-   **Experiment Tracking:** Logging parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files for every training run.
-   **Model Management:** Storing, versioning, and managing trained models in a centralized registry.
-   **Reproducibility:** Ensuring that every part of the experiment can be reliably reproduced.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Deep Dive

- **Automated CI/CD:** Implemented a full **CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline**, which automatically triggers on commits to the GitHub repository.
- **Containerization:** The Flask API and ML model are containerized using **Docker**, creating a portable and reproducible system.
- **Cloud Container Registry:** The Docker image is automatically built by AWS CodeBuild and stored in **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.
- **Scalable Deployment:** The containerized application is deployed on **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate** (or **AWS App Runner**), providing a serverless, auto-scaling, and resilient production environment.
- **Machine Learning Model:** An Elastic Net regression model trained with Scikit-learn to predict wine quality.
- **REST API:** A production-ready API built with **Flask** exposes the model for real-time inference.

## ‚öôÔ∏è MLOps Pipeline Architecture

This project follows a professional, event-driven MLOps architecture:

1.  **Source (GitHub):** A developer pushes a code change to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository.
2.  **CI/CD Trigger (GitHub Actions):** This push automatically triggers a pre-configured workflow in **GitHub Actions**.
3.  **Self-Hosted Runner (EC2):** The GitHub Actions job is picked up by a self-hosted runner configured on an **AWS EC2 instance**.
4.  **Build & Push (Docker & ECR):** The runner executes the CI/CD steps:
    -   It builds the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`.
    -   It logs into **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** using credentials stored in GitHub Secrets.
    -   It pushes the new Docker image to our ECR repository.
5.  **Deploy (EC2):** The final step in the workflow pulls the latest image from ECR onto the same EC2 instance and runs the new container, updating the live application.
